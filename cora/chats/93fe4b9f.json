Specifically, it states that \"expected an indented block after function definition on line 1.\"\n\nThe issue is that the function definition `def colon(x):` is incomplete and lacks an indented block of code following it. To correct this, you can add a colon at the end of the function definition and indent the next block of code accordingly. This will ensure that the code follows proper syntax and is correctly structured.\n\nThe suggested fix provided by the system is to add a colon at the end of the function definition and indent the next block of code as follows:\n```python\ndef colon(x):\n    # Your code here\n```\nThis corrected code will ensure that the function definition is complete and correctly formatted, resolving the syntax error.
