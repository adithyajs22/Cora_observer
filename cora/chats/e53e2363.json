The error message indicates that there is a missing indentation after the function definition on line 1 of the `test.py` file, specifically in the colon operator (`:`) following the function name.\n\nThe correct fix would be to add an indented block of code following the function definition:\n```python\ndef colon(x):\n    # Add your code here\n    # Example:\n    return x * 2\n```\nThis would ensure that the block of code within the function is properly indented and follows Python's syntax rules, which requires that any code that comes after a function definition be indented. The corrected code with indentation added is shown below:\n```python\ndef colon(x):\n    # Add your code here\n    # Example:\n    return x * 2\n```\nAfter applying the fix and re-running the script, this should resolve the syntax error in `test.py`.
